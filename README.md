# metroidvania-observations
Observations of my favorite metroidvania games (in no particular order)

- Hollow Knight
- Ori and the Blind Forest
- Axiom Verge
- Guacamelee!
- Dust: An Elysian Tail
- Shovel Knight (not metroidvania but still inspirational)
- Hyper Light Drifter (not metroidvania but still inspirational)
- SteamWorld Dig

## Inventory/menus
### Hollow Knight
- SELECT: Inventory menu overlays the current scene (doesn't pause, sound effects continue to play). Tab for map, tab for inventory (i.e., abilities, key items), tab for charm system.
- START: Pause menu overlays the current scene. Freezes the background and sound effects.

## Character abilities
### Hollow Knight
- Dash, double jump, acid resistance, "shadow" dash, ground slam, wall jump, "extended" dash
- Weapon upgrades are available with hard to find pickups
- Charm system (i.e., talents) to modify player in smaller ways (e.g., larger melee hitbox)

## Platforming
### Hollow Knight
- Variable jump height. Generous height
- Precise vertical and horizontal movement
- Friction along walls after unlocking wall jump
- Wall jumps happen at 45 degrees
- Ghost jumping? (~100ms)

## Combat
### Hollow Knight
- Large part of the game. Precise hitbox, smooth attack animation
- Spells are in the game but not really necessary. 90% of combat is done with the melee weapon (nail)
- Satisfying hit/death
- Knockback when melee attack lands. This also enables bouncing vertically on top of enemies using the melee weapon (some platforming is solved this way too).
- Invincibility frames and knockback when hit
- Enemies leave corpses and drop currency. They also give you health when attacked

## General design observations
### Hollow Knight
- Rooms are large but not continous. Enemy death is remembered temporarily
- Fast travel possible from certain points
- Charms only changeable from save locations
- If you die you restart at a save location
- Spikes restart you to the nearest platform (i.e., they aren't insta-death)
- Parallax background
- Insects, carapace, decay
- Character has an aura of light around him, scenes are dark
- Dust follows the character when walking and also when jumping. Dynamic direction (i.e., it briefly curves mid-air)
- Slower movement speed in town
- Lots of environment to interact with (i.e., breakables, detritus). Impressive amount of objects that can be cut with the weapon
- Press up to interact with environment (e.g., talk with NPC, enter a building)
